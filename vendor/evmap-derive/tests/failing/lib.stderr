    = note: the method `shallow_copy` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
            `Cell<()>: ShallowCopy`
            which is required by `Generic<Cell<()>>: ShallowCopy`
    = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
    = note: the following trait defines an item `shallow_copy`, perhaps you need to implement it:
            candidate #1: `ShallowCopy`
