//! Networking-related types not available in core.
//!
//! This module either re-exports or re-defines a number of types related to
//! networking that are not available in a `no_std` environment but are used
//! in DNS data. Currently, these are types for IP addresses.
//!
//! The `no_std` version currently is only the bare minimum implementation
//! and doesnâ€™t provide all the features the `std` version has.
